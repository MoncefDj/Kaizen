## Introduction: The Gift

- Gifted individuals, who are exceptionally skilled or talented in specific areas, are not inherently born with those abilities or capabilities.
- There are several crucial factors that contribute to a person's talent in a particular field:
  1. Engaging in practice at a young age, typically before the age of six.
  1. Growing up in an environment that fosters unconscious practice.
  1. Engaging in deliberate practice for a significant period of time, using the right methods.
- While genetics can be advantageous, they do not have a significant impact when compared to the factors mentioned above.
- Merely working hard is not enough to become a talented individual. It is essential to work diligently and employ deliberate practice as the most effective approach to achieve expertise.
