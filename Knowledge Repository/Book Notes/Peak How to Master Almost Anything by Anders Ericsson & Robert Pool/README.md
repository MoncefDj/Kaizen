## Introduction: The Gift

- Gifted individuals, who are exceptionally skilled or talented in specific areas, are not inherently born with those abilities or capabilities.
- There are several crucial factors that contribute to a person's talent in a particular field:
  1. Engaging in practice at a young age, typically before the age of six.
  1. Growing up in an environment that fosters unconscious practice.
  1. Engaging in deliberate practice for a significant period of time, using the right methods.
- While genetics can be advantageous, they do not have a significant impact when compared to the factors mentioned above.
- Merely working hard is not enough to become a talented individual. It is essential to work diligently and employ deliberate practice as the most effective approach to achieve expertise.

## 1| The Power of Purposeful Practice

- In an experiment aimed at increasing the number of digits that a person can remember at once, Eric and Steve discovered a method that yielded surprising results. According to Eric, the method involved starting with a random five-digit string. If Steve guessed it correctly (which he always did), they would proceed to a six-digit string. If Steve continued to guess correctly, they would increase the length of the string by one digit each time. However, if Steve guessed incorrectly, Eric would decrease the length of the string by two digits and they would start again.
