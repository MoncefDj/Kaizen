# Deep Work by Cal Newport

## Introduction

### Deep Work

Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

### Shallow Work

Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

### The Deep Work Hypothesis

The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

## Part 1| The Idea

- You need to be able to quickly master hard things and produce at an elite level (in terms of both quality and speed).

- The New Law of Productivity: High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

- Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, can produce a lot of valuable output.

- The Principle of Least Resistance: in a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.

- Busyness as Proxy for Productivity: in the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.

## Part 2| The Rules

### Rule |1 Work Deeply

- To make Deep Work a habit, add routines. This reduces the willpower necessary to transition into a state of unbroken concentration. The 4 Deep Work Philosophies:

  - Monastic: isolate yourself for long periods of time without distractions; no shallow work allowed.
  - Bimodal: reserve a few consecutive days when you will be working like a monastic (you need at least one day a week).
  - Rhythmic: take 3-4 hours every day to perform deep work on your project.
  - Journalistic: alternate your day between deep and shallow work as it fits your blocks of time (not recommended to try out first). Commit to scheduling deep work blocks into your calendar and sticking to them (time blocking). Scheduling a specific time of the day in advance takes away the need to use willpower.

- To build your Deep Work routine, decide:

  - Where you’ll work and for how long
  - How you’ll work once you start to work
  - How you’ll support your work
  - Execute Like a Business
