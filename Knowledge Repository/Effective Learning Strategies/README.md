# Effective Learning Strategies

## Active Learning

Active learning involves actively engaging with the material you are trying to learn. Instead of just passively reading or listening, active learning means taking an active role. Examples of active learning include taking notes while reading, asking questions about the material, summarizing key points, and teaching the information to others. Active learning improves understanding and retention.

## Spaced Repetition

Spaced repetition is based on reviewing material over time at gradually increasing intervals. Instead of cramming everything into one study session, you spread out your learning over multiple sessions. This reinforces and strengthens your memory over time. Many apps use spaced repetition algorithms to help optimize your study schedule. As you successfully recall a piece of information, the app increases the time before you review it again. This helps you efficiently retain knowledge long-term.

## Retrieval Practice

Retrieval practice involves actively recalling information from memory through activities like self-testing with flashcards or practice exams. Retrieval practice helps identify knowledge gaps and strengthens your ability to recall information.

## Interleaving

Interleaving means mixing up the topics and skills you study in each session. Rather than intensively studying one thing at a time, you switch between different types of material. Interleaving helps you make connections between topics so you better understand how they relate. It aids long-term retention and transfer.

## Elaboration

Elaboration involves making connections between new information and your existing knowledge and experiences. You can use analogies, examples, explanations, and descriptions to integrate new concepts with what you already know. Making these meaningful connections improves your ability to understand abstract or complex ideas. Effective elaboration strategies include turning a formula into a visual model or explaining information in your own words.
