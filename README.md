# Kaizen: Documenting My Self-Improvement Journey

This repository is dedicated to documenting my personal journey of self-improvement using the kaizen philosophy of continuous improvement. The idea behind kaizen is to make small, incremental improvements every day in order to achieve significant results over time.

In this repository, I'll explore various ways to apply the kaizen philosophy to my learning journey.
