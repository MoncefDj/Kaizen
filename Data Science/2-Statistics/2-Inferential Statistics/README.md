## Point Estimates and Confidence Intervals

In statistics, a point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate an unknown parameter of a population. For example, if we want to estimate the average height of all students in a school, we might take a random sample of students and use their average height as a point estimate of the population mean height.

The key difference between a statistic and a point estimate is that a statistic is a value calculated from a sample of data, while a point estimate is a single value used to estimate an unknown population parameter.

However, a point estimate alone may not be enough to fully capture the uncertainty associated with the estimate. This is where confidence intervals come in. A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of the population parameter with a certain level of confidence. The level of confidence is usually expressed as a percentage, such as 95% or 99%.

## T-Distribution

The t-distribution, also known as Studentâ€™s t-distribution, is a way of describing data that follow a bell curve when plotted on a graph, with the greatest number of observations close to the mean and fewer observations in the tails.

It is a type of normal distribution used for smaller sample sizes, where the variance in the data is unknown.
