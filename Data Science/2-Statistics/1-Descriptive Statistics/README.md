## Population (N)

In statistics, a population is the entire group of individuals, objects, or measurements that we are interested in studying. The numbers obtained from analyzing a population are called parameters.

## Sample (n)

A sample is a smaller group of individuals, objects, or measurements that we select from the population to represent it. The numbers obtained from analyzing a sample are called statistics. Statistics are used to estimate parameters for the population.

## Data Types

Data can be classified into two main types:

### Categorical Data

Categorical data describes categories or groups that have no inherent order or numerical significance.

### Numerical Data

Numerical data describes numbers and can be further classified into two types:

#### Discrete Data

Discrete data consists of whole numbers or integers and can be counted in a finite manner.

#### Continuous Data

Continuous data consists of real numbers and is infinite and impossible to count.

## Data Measurements

Measurements can be classified into two levels:

### Qualitative Data

Qualitative data refers to non-numeric data and can be further classified into two types:

#### Nominal Data

Nominal data consists of categories or groups that have no inherent order or numerical significance.

#### Ordinal Data

Ordinal data consists of categories or groups that have a natural order or ranking.

### Quantitative Data

Quantitative data refers to numeric data and can be further classified into two types:

#### Interval Data

Interval data consists of numeric values that have equal intervals between them but do not have a true zero point.

#### Ratio Data

Ratio data consists of numeric values that have equal intervals between them and a true zero point, meaning that ratios of the values are meaningful.

## Measures of central tendency

### Mean

![how do we find the mean](<Photos/how do we find the mean.png>)

### Median

the median is the number at the position (n+1)/2 in the ordered list.

### Mod

the mod is the value that occurs most often

## Measures of asymmetry

### Skewness

## Measures of variability

### Variance

The variance is a measure of variability that represents how spread out the data is from the mean.

### standard deviation

The standard deviation is a measure of variability that represents the average amount that each data point deviates from the mean.

### Coefficient of variation

The coefficient of variation is a measure of variability that represents the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. It is often used to compare the variability of datasets with different means.

## Measures of relationship between variables

### Covariance

Covariance is a measure of the relationship between two variables. It indicates how much two variables change together. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to change in opposite directions.

### Linear corelation coefficient

The linear correlation coefficient, is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where a value of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation.
