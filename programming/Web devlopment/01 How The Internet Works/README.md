# How The Internet Works

When a user types a URL such as "www.google.com" into their browser and hits enter, the browser sends a request to the user's Internet Service Provider (ISP) asking for the IP address associated with that URL. The ISP then queries a Domain Name System (DNS) server, which acts like a phone book for the internet, and returns the IP address associated with the requested URL.

Once the browser receives the IP address, it sends a request to the server associated with that IP address, asking for the files necessary to display the requested webpage. The server responds by sending the necessary files to the browser.

Finally, the browser processes the files it received from the server and displays them as a webpage for the user to interact with. This process happens behind the scenes and quickly, allowing users to access millions of web pages with just a few clicks.
