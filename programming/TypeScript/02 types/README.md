# Primitive Types in TypeScript

In TypeScript, the three primitive types are `number`, `string`, and `boolean`. It is generally considered bad practice to use the `any` type, as it can lead to type errors and make code harder to maintain.

## Functions with Void and Never Types

A function with the `void` type returns nothing, while a function with the `never` type does not return at all.
