# Introduction

In my exploration of TypeScript, I discovered that it is a valuable tool for developers as it enables them to write safer and more reliable JavaScript code. To get started with TypeScript, I installed it globally on my PC using the command "npm install -g typescript" in Microsoft PowerShell as an administrator. To verify that I had installed TypeScript correctly, I used the command "tsc -v" in Git Bash.
